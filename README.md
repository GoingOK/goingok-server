# goingok-server

This is the server side code for a full stack providing [GoingOK](http://goingok.org), a web application for personal reflective writing. The application was developed by [Andrew Gibson](http://andrewresearch.net) as part of his Doctoral research on Reflective Writing Analytics. It is now an open source project.
 
 This repo provides the REST API for [goingok-client](https://github.com/GoingOK/goingok-client).

### Quick Start

1. Ensure that you are running a postgreSQL server and that you have an empty GoingOK database

2. Change the name of ```application_conf_templ``` to ```aplication.conf``` ([src/main/resources/](src/main/resources)), and edit it to include *your* database settings.

3. Compile with ```sbt compile``` and run with ```sbt run```

4. Connecting to ```http://localhost:8080/v1/health``` should return json...

```json
{
  "message": "ok"
}
```

### Documentation

For more detailed documentation on both client and server components, see the current [docs](http://goingok.org/docs/).
